# Hi, I'm Pavan 👋

I did my undergraduate degree in Agriculture and my Masters in Computer Technology.  
Right now I’m focused on Generative AI and Python, and I’m interested in applying them both to agriculture and to other real-world problems.

This GitHub is where I track my learning and experiments.

## What I'm focusing on

- Learning GenAI concepts: embeddings, vector databases, RAG, and agents  
- Practising Python by building small, clear projects  
- Testing ideas that combine my agriculture background with AI  
- Exploring other domains where GenAI can be useful (not only agri)
- just trying to get used of git
